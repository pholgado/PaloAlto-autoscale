# Auto Scaling the VM-Series-firewall on Azure

Palo Alto Networks now provides templates to help you deploy an auto-scaling tier of VM-Series firewalls
using several Azure services such as Virtual Machine Scale Sets, Application Insights, Azure Load Balancers,
Azure functions, Panorama and the Panorama plugin for Azure, and the VM-Series automation capabilities
including the PAN-OS API and bootstrapping. The templates allow you to leverage the scalability features
on Azure that are designed to manage sudden surges in demand for application workload resources by
independently scaling the VM-Series firewalls with the changing workloads.

## History
### Version 1.1 - Sep 2020
The release of version 1.1 is provided as a community supported, i.e. best effort, release. You can consider this as an open beta to introduce new features and collect feedback for improving the generally available release that will be officially supported.

Azure Auto Scale Template 1.1 introduces two new options for your VM-Series firewall on Azure autoscaling deployment.


• Application Insight Resource Region—in the inbound and hub templates, you can now specify the region for your Application Insight Resource. A new drop-down has been added to the template that allows you to specify the region. See Parameters in the Auto Scaling Templates for Azure for more information.

• Hardware-Based VM-Series Model PAYG License—beginning with PAN-OS 9.1.3, a PAYG license applies a VM-Series capacity license based on the hardware allocated to the instance. the PAYG instance checks the amount of hardware resources available to the instance and applies the largest VM-Series firewall capacity license allowed for the resources available. See VM-Series Firewall Licenses for Public Clouds for more information.



### Version 1.0 - Feb 2019  
The initial release of version 1.0 is provided as a community supported, i.e. best effort, release. You can consider this as an open beta to introduce new features and collect feedback for improving the generally available release that will be officially supported.

### Version 1.0.0-6 GA Release - July 2019
This release is now generally available. The hub and inbound template, as well as the infra template, is released under the official support policy of Palo Alto Networks through the support options that you've purchased, for example Premium Support, support teams, or ASC (Authorized Support Centers) partners and Premium Partner Support options. The support scope is restricted to troubleshooting for the stated/intended use cases and product versions specified in the project documentation and does not cover customization of the scripts or templates.

The application template is Community Supported.
